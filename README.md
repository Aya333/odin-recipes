# odin-recipes
# Recipes project:
In this project I am required to make web pages containing recipes using HTML only for now.
I enjoyed working on it and got carried away adding up to 6 different recipes but that helped twwsting my skills out which was great.

# What did i learn?
I learned how to create a good web page structure to build on top of in the future, as well as practice my skills and see how i can use my knowledge to create them such as using containers and nestiing elements.
