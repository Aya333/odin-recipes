        <h2>Discription</h2>
        <p>
          French toast, also known as “eggy bread” is a breakfast favourite, and
          this cinnamon and vanilla version is a classic. Slices of white, brown
          or raisin bread are covered in whisked eggs and milk, then cooked in
          the oven for about 30 minutes. Save time and soak bread ahead of time,
          keeping refrigerated until ready to bake.

      <h2>Steps</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            For the French toast: Grease the baking pan with butter. Tear the
            bread into chunks, or cut into cubes, and evenly distribute in the
            pan. Crack the eggs in a big bowl. Whisk together the eggs, milk,
            cream, granulated sugar, brown sugar and vanilla. Pour evenly over
            the bread. Cover the pan tightly and store in the fridge until
            needed (overnight preferably).
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            For the topping: Mix the flour, brown sugar, cinnamon, salt and some
            nutmeg in a separate bowl. Stir together using a fork. Add the
            butter and with a pastry cutter, and mix it all together until the
            mixture resembles fine pebbles. Store in a re-sealable plastic bag
            in the fridge.
          </p>
        </li>

          <p>
            When you're ready to bake the casserole, preheat the oven to 350
            degrees F. Remove the casserole from the fridge and sprinkle the
            topping over the top. Bake for 45 minutes for a softer, more bread
            pudding texture or for 1 hour or more for a firmer, crisper texture.
          </p>
        </li>

          <p>
            Scoop out individual portions. Top with butter and drizzle with warm
            pancake syrup and sprinkle with blueberries.
