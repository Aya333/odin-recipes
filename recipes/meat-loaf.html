        <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p>
          Meatloaf is a dish of ground meat that has been combined with other
          ingredients and formed into the shape of a loaf, then baked or smoked.
          The final shape is either hand-formed on a baking tray, or pan-formed
          by cooking it in a loaf pan

      <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon good olive oil</li>
        <li>3 cups chopped yellow onions (3 onions)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon chopped fresh thyme leaves</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>1/3 cup canned chicken stock or broth</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon tomato paste</li>
        <li>2 1/2 pounds ground chuck (81 percent lean)</li>
        <li>1/2 cup plain dry bread crumbs (recommended: Progresso)</li>
        <li>2 extra-large eggs, beaten</li>
        <li>1/2 cup ketchup (recommended: Heinz)</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Steps:</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Heat the olive oil in a medium saute pan. Add the onions, thyme,
            salt, and pepper and cook over medium-low heat, stirring
            occasionally, for 8 to 10 minutes, until the onions are translucent
            but not brown. Off the heat, add the Worcestershire sauce, chicken
            stock, and tomato paste. Allow to cool slightly.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            In a large bowl, combine the ground chuck, onion mixture, bread
            crumbs, and eggs, and mix lightly with a fork. Don't mash or the
            meat loaf will be dense. Shape the mixture into a rectangular loaf
            on a sheet pan covered with parchment paper. Spread the ketchup
            evenly on top. Bake for 1 to 1 1/4 hours, until the internal
            temperature is 160 degrees F and the meat loaf is cooked through. (A
            pan of hot water in the oven, under the meat loaf, will keep the top
            from cracking.) Serve hot.
