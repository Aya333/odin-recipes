        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
          Molten chocolate cake is a popular dessert that combines the elements
          of a chocolate cake and a souffl√©. Its name derives from the dessert's
          liquid chocolate center, and it is also known as chocolate moelleux,
          chocolate lava cake, or simply lava cake.

            Microwave the butter, bittersweet chocolate and semisweet chocolate
            in a large bowl on high until the butter is melted, about 1 minute.
            Whisk until the chocolate is also melted. Stir in the sugar until
            well blended. Whisk in the eggs and egg yolks, then add the vanilla.
            Stir in the flour. Divide the mixture among the custard cups.

            Bake until the sides are firm and the centers are soft, about 13
            minutes. Let stand 1 minute. Invert on individual plates while warm
            and serve with vanilla ice cream.
